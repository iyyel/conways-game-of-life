### Issues to fix
1. Clicking on a predefined universe (after opening the predefined universe modal) should change the current state to stopped if its running. 
2. History is not behaving correctly.
3. Perhaps update the description of the different predefined universes.

### TODO
1. Write a readme.
2. Write a blog post.
3. SEO?
